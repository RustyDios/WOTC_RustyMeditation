[h1] What Is This ?[/h1]
This mod pulls the 'Meditation' ability from the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2024073766] Caster Gauntlets [/url] and grants it to normal Templar Shard Gauntlets. Made with permission from the original author.

[h1] Why ?[/h1]
This is to avoid the mod conflict with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1445339034] Supreme Focus [/url] from the other ability/items of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2024073766] Caster Gauntlets [/url] and thus allows you to use the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1445339034] Supreme Focus [/url] mod as a class based ability, like originally intended.

[h1] Config Options [/h1]
Included in the config files are settings for;
[list]
[*]How much focus to grant, default is 2
[*]How many action points to use, default is 2, not free, not turn ending
[*]Cooldown turns, default is 3
[*]Charges, default is not required
[*]Self damage values, default is 0
[/list]
Config folder contains an optional re-spec of the Templar Skill tree, see the XComClassData_Optional file for instructions on how to use.

[h1] Compatibility/Issues [/h1]
Obviously designed to work with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1445339034] Supreme Focus [/url]
Weirdly enough shouldn't crash if used with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2024073766] Caster Gauntlets [/url], but using both defeats the purpose of this mod.

No known issues
